                        or a relaxing evening in the hot tub under the stars, this cabin
                        offers a calm, low-key mountain experience.

                <p>
                    <b>Greetings!  We are Mike and Debbie, the owners of this property.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our family moved from Atlanta to the North Georgia mountains in March of
                    1998.  After taking just one vacation up to the area, we decided right away that
                    we wanted to raise our family here!  It was beautiful, peaceful, and allowed us to
                    keep a simple lifestyle.  We have 10 children, and we knew this would be a
                    perfect environment for the family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Life circumstances caused us to move out of the area in 2009, but we have since
                    been blessed to be able to purchase this home for our present and future
                    enjoyment and relaxation.  We have decorated and furnished the home with
                    much thought and care, just as if we were personally living in it full time, so that
                    our guests can enjoy the house and the property as fully as we do when we are
                    staying here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We sincerely hope that your stay in our home is relaxing and memorable.  Our
                    goal is that you would never want to leave, and that you would return and visit
                    often!  Thank you for choosing Heaven’s view for your mountain vacation
                    getaway, we sincerely hope that you enjoy your stay!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Benny was the most positive-minded person you would ever meet. He had an
                    infectious smile that would brighten up any room in seconds. He held no
                    grudges, forgave unconditionally, and had an encouraging word for everyone.
                    Benny was crazy, hilarious, and his happiness and laughter were contagious
                    to everyone he was around. Benny loved everyone, hated no one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Benny was passionate about his family and was a strong and unapologetic
                    defender of his Christian faith. He adored his fiancé Allee, whom he was
                    planning to marry in April 2024.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All throughout Benny’s life, he was willing to give of himself
                    unconditionally. He bore the burdens of his friends and family members and
                    would willingly do anything he could to help. Benny was a friend to the
                    friendless, a counselor to the troubled, a protector of those who were
                    bullied, and he had the gentlest spirit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our son Benjamin, our 9th child, was born February 11, 2004, in Blue Ridge,
                    Georgia. Benny’s precious life was taken by a drunk driver on June 15, 2023.
                    He was only 19 years old.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Benny was a willing organ donor. At the end of his life, he continued to
                    give—helping a 9-year-old boy receive a new heart, a 21-year-old man receive
                    a new liver, and a 62-year-old man receive a new set of lungs. All the love
                    that existed in Benny’s life was carried into his eternity. Even in his
                    death, Benny continued to dramatically affect the lives of others.
