                        deck as the sun rises, an afternoon spent exploring nearby trails,
                        or a relaxing evening in the hot tub under the stars, this cabin
                        offers a calm, low-key mountain experience.

                <h2>About Heaven’s View</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Greetings!  We are Mike and Debbie, the owners of this property.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our family moved from Atlanta to the North Georgia mountains in March of
                    1998.  After taking just one vacation up to the area, we decided right away that
                    we wanted to raise our family here!  It was beautiful, peaceful, and allowed us to
                    keep a simple lifestyle.  We have 10 children, and we knew this would be a
                    perfect environment for the family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Life circumstances caused us to move out of the area in 2009, but we have since
                    been blessed to be able to purchase this home for our present and future
                    enjoyment and relaxation.  We have decorated and furnished the home with
                    much thought and care, just as if we were personally living in it full time, so that
                    our guests can enjoy the house and the property as fully as we do when we are
                    staying here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We sincerely hope that your stay in our home is relaxing and memorable.  Our
                    goal is that you would never want to leave, and that you would return and visit
                    often!  Thank you for choosing Heaven’s view for your mountain vacation
                    getaway, we sincerely hope that you enjoy your stay!
                </p>
